# KNN-Clustering-on-the-Iris-dataset

In this project, I chose KNN as the model because upon doing the pairplot, I could see that the data points do cluster relatively well. In particular, there are three scatterplots where clusters formed can clearly be seen. These are SepalLengthCm vs PetalWidthCm, SepalWidthCm vs PetalWidthCm, and PetalLengthCm vs PetalWidthCm. Going forward with these, I made KNN models and was able to compare their scores. I used a relplot to show which data points the model predicted wrong and which ones were right.
